[How to Make a Digital Personality of Yourself Using Chatbots, Facebook, and Empathy](https://medium.com/@johnnyfived/how-to-make-a-digital-personality-of-yourself-using-chatbots-facebook-and-empathy-8b0c53afa9bd)

This repository contains the full source code for a sentiment analyzer library called Emote, and its companion program Emoter, a chatbot intergrated with Emote's emotional analysis to allow for some programmatic sense of "empathy."

Emote uses NLTK's (through TextBlob's wrapper) naive Bayes classifier, and was trained on over 8000 quotations from various film, literature, and digital sources of dialogues. There are a total of 26 different emotional tone classifications currently, with an additional 10 further tones that can be extrapolated from clustering / grouping related tones. Emote can be run with a CLI, or used as a library, and includes a basic REST API.

Emoter includes a (mostly) automated way of parsing Facebook messages to build a text corpus off an individual person's Facebook profile, inspired by [Black Mirror](https://tv.avclub.com/black-mirror-be-right-back-1798178877). Emoter chatbots can be run with a CLI, or used as a library.

These works were developed for my undergraduate thesis project at Parsons School of Design in 2017.

Are you using Emote in a project or app? Or do you hate it and think it sucks? I'd love to know more, email me at johnnyddunn@gmail.com.

## Prerequisites

* Python 3.5 or higher
* TextBlob
* NLTK
* NumPy
* pandas
* scikit-learn


## Introduction

Emote uses the TextBlob / NLTK, NumPy, pandas, and scikit-learn libraries to build a probabilistic sentiment analyzer for 26 different classifications. These classifications have been divided into 13 pairs of opposites, and are designed to be grouped together to create tone clusters that can then lead to further tone classifications (currently for a total of 36), as well as decrease false positive detections.

Emoter is a basic but functional chatbot library intergrated with Emote, in order to give conversational agents the ability to better empathize with users and give back more emotionally appropriate responses. Essentially, Emoter is able to understand user intentions by analyzing user with Emote, then choosing specific, interchangable "conversations" (lists of text responses) to respond from.

Both Emote and Emoter can be run offline. Emote comes with a REST API for basic sentiment analysis, and has a mass analysis feature (currently only supporting CSV and text files).

### Full List of Emotional Tone Classifications

```
Positive, negative; love, hate; joy, anger; certainty, confusion; amusement, boredom; intensity, regret; challenging, agreeable; desire, calm; sarcastic, emphatic; instructive, accusative; admiration, inquisitive; modest, pride; ambivalence, vulgarity
```

```
10 additional tones can be derived from the 26 base tones through combining associations: obedience, assertiveness; attraction, disgust; informative, malevolent; anxiety, excitement; hopeful, horror.
```

## Installing

Once you create your virtual environment, run the setup file or install the dependencies via pip. 

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
<!-- 
On Windows and Mac, you will have to manually install NumPy+MKL.

Go to these links below to download NumPy+MKL and SciPy+MKL packages.

[http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#numpy](http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#numpy)

[http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#scipy](http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#scipy)

Cd to the directory where the whl files are while in your virtual env, and run this command to install the packages:
```
pip install package_name_downloaded_here.whl
``` -->

Then, download the necessary corpora to use TextBlob:
```
python -m textblob.download_corpora
```

<!-- Because GitHub has a file upload limitation, and to save space, I've uploaded a pickled version of the probability classifier, so that it doesn't have to rebuild every time Emote is reloaded.  -->

<!-- Now download the pickled classifier file (so the data doesn't have to be re-trained every time). -->

<!-- [http://www.mediafire.com/file/c18ll802ynb7s3c/base_corpus.pickle](http://www.mediafire.com/file/c18ll802ynb7s3c/base_corpus.pickle) -->

<!-- Put the pickle file in the /data directory of Emoter / Emote, or build the pickled file yourself with your own custom database automatically by running emote.py. -->

<!-- NOTE: You may have to train your own model based on the data in the repo.  -->


## Training the Model

Because GitHub has a file upload limitation, and to save space, I've uploaded a pickled version of the probability classifier here:

[http://www.mediafire.com/file/c18ll802ynb7s3c/base_corpus.pickle](http://www.mediafire.com/file/c18ll802ynb7s3c/base_corpus.pickle)

When upgrading to the latest library updates, the classifier was throwing errors for me when loading a downloaded (pre-built) pickled model.

You should be able to put the pickle file in the /data directory within Emote, but that doesn't seem to be the case now.

To train Emote's classifier, you will have to copy and paste all the lines in base_corpus.txt (or whatever your corpus is called) within /data into the list var 'self.train', initialized in the beginning of emote.py. So, self.train will then be a list of tuples comprised of the data from base_corpus.txt. 

<img src="/screenshots/emote-training-copy-and-paste-here.png?raw=true" width="600px" />

In the future, this will be changed so each line is read from a selected corpus text into Emote when it's initialized (at the moment, reading the base corpus text into a list gives errors with escaped chars in).

When you've finished editing emote.py, run the script and the training will begin automatically. 

<img src="/screenshots/emote-training-base-corpus-into-pickle.png?raw=true" width="600px" />

When the classifier has finished training, it will automatically be saved into a pickle file in /data, to be loaded into Emote so the model doesn't have to be rebuilt every time.

See the image below for a reference to how quotations in the base corpus were trained:

## Using Emote (Sentiment Analysis)

Emote.py will start the basic command line interface.

Emoter_trainer_wrapper.py offers a more advanced CLI for Emote, and is meant to be used to train and test Emote's database, but is not fully functional yet. 

Run_emote.py starts Emote's app (Flask) and REST API. Go to localhost:8080/ in your browser to use the web interface.

When you're running Emote for the first time, it'll automatically analyze an empty message, so that the initial loading of the classifier is done (so the first analysis made will take longer to finish).

### REST API Usage

Run_emote.py starts the app by default on port 8080. Deployed locally, you can use the API as follows:

#### Sentiment analysis for single sentences:

```
api/sentiment/<text>
```

returns JSON list of 26 base emotional tones and their percentage levels.

#### Sentiment analysis for 26 tones for multiple sentences / paragraphs:

```
api/sentiment/sentences/<text>
```

returns JSON dictionary with keys being each sentence found in the text, and values containing lists of the corresponding classified sentiments.

#### Example:

```
http://localhost:8080/api/sentiment/My cherries and wine, rosemary and thyme And all of my peaches are ruined
```
returns:
```
{ "result": [ [ "intensity", 100.0 ], [ "agreeable", 44.800000000000004 ], [ "inquisitive", 24.099999999999998 ], [ "emphatic", 24.0 ], [ "anger", 19.1 ], [ "certainty", 14.7 ], [ "challenging", 11.200000000000001 ], [ "instructive", 6.0 ], [ "hate", 4.6 ], [ "accusative", 4.6 ], [ "desire", 3.1 ], [ "positive", 1.7000000000000002 ], [ "confusion", 1.6 ], [ "negative", 0.4 ], [ "calm", 0.4 ], [ "vulgarity", 0.4 ], [ "joy", 0.0 ], [ "love", 0.0 ], [ "amusement", 0.0 ], [ "boredom", 0.0 ], [ "regret", 0.0 ], [ "sarcastic", 0.0 ], [ "admiration", 0.0 ], [ "modest", 0.0 ], [ "pride", 0.0 ], [ "ambivalence", 0.0 ] ] }

```

### Library Usage

Start by importing emote.
```
import emote as emote
```
Send text message to be analyzed.
```
em = emote.Emote()
message = "Duct tape. I need it for... taping something."
result = em.runAnalysis(message)
```
You will get a list of tuples of all the emotional tone values in descending order as a result:
```
[('desire', 100.0), ('emphatic', 14.7), ('certainty', 9.6), ('challenging', 5.0), ('agreeable', 3.1), ('instructive', 2.4), ('intensity', 2.3), ('accusative', 2.0), ('anger', 1.4000000000000001), ('inquisitive', 0.7000000000000001), ('confusion', 0.4), ('hate', 0.1), ('negative', 0.0), ('calm', -0.0), ('regret', -0.0), ('modest', -0.1), ('vulgarity', -0.1), ('pride', -0.1), ('love', -0.1), ('positive', -0.1), ('amusement', -0.1), ('joy', -0.1), ('admiration', -0.1), ('sarcastic', -0.1), ('boredom', -0.1), ('ambivalence', -0.1)]
```
You can get values from the result like this:
```
result[0]
```
returns the strongest tone classification-value pair:
```
('desire', 100.0)
```
and
```
result[0][0]
```
returns the strongest tone classification:
```
'desire'
```
while
```
result[0][1]
```
returns the strongest tone value:
```
100.0
```
And so
```
result[1]
```
returns the 2nd strongest tone classification-value pair:
```
('emphatic', 14.7)
```
and so on for all 26 base tones, in descending order of value. Eventually, the API will be expanded to return more data like a descriptive psychological analysis, hence why the result is returned as a list.

### Web UI

To use Emote's web interface and mass analyzer feature (for CSV data input / output), start run_emote.py, and go to localhost:8080/ in your browser:

## Using Emoter (Chatbot)

Emoter can be run as a script with a CLI, or used as a library in Python. By default, Emoter's corpus consists of example texts for a virtual fitness coach / trainer. To customize or make your own chatbot, you can add a new 'brain' in the /data folder, using the 'fitness_coach' files as a template. Emoter brains currently consist of a folder of text files comprised of tuples (eventually, the brains will use SQL).

Start by importing emoter.
```
import emoter as emt
```
Send a message for the bot to analyze and respond to..
```
emtBot = emt.Emoter()
message = "Hey there, how are you?"
result = emtBot.getMsg(message)
```
You will get a string returned with Emoter's matching response statement to your message.
```
print(result)
Hello, how can I help you?
```

This is what the dir structure for an Emoter bot corpus looks like (example corpus, 'fitness_coach', which loads by default):

<img src="/screenshots/emoter-corpus-template-structure.png?raw=true" width="600px" />

Fitness_coach brain working in action.

<img src="/screenshots/emoter_demo_3.png?raw=true" width="600px" />

You can follow the tone of the fitness_coach brain files to determine how to appropriately divide up your dialog to work best with Emoter's 'empathy.' Soon, there will be an automatic texts parser / trainer (emoter_corpus_fb_parser.py) that creates the new files and templates required for a full conversation corpus through a command line interface, from Facebook message archives. This will effectively create a brain, or persona, of an actual person through their Facebook messages.

To load a different, stored corpus in the same Emoter instance, you must have all the necessary text files to build the corpus, in a folder within /data. Pass the exact name of the folder name as the single parameter for Emoter(brain_path).

```
import emoter as emt
brain_path = "custom_bot_name"
emtBot = emt.Emoter(brain_path)
emtBot.getMsg("hello emoter")
```
To train an existing Emoter with a new brain (must be located within /data:

```
new_brain_path = "different_virtual_assistant"
emtBot.trainDatabase(new_brain_path)
```

To use Emoter's web interface (which was built for an art exhibit to be displayed on a CRT monitor, hence the aesthetics), start run_emoter.py, and go to localhost:5000 (port 5000 by default) in your browser:

<img src="/screenshots/emoter-web-demo-1.png?raw=true" width="600px" />

<img src="/screenshots/emoter-web-demo-2.png?raw=true" width="600px" />

### Generating an Emoter corpus from Facebook messages

First of all, this system does not work especially well, and is pretty hacked together. Follow at your own caution.

Go here to download your Facebook archive:
[https://www.facebook.com/help/131112897028467](https://www.facebook.com/help/131112897028467).

Then, use the Facebook Chart Archive Parser tool, which can be downloaded here:
[https://github.com/ownaginatious/fbchat-archive-parser](https://github.com/ownaginatious/fbchat-archive-parser).

Or installed with pip:
```
pip install fbchat-archive-parser
```

With fbchat-archive-parser installed in your virtual environment, cd into the folder containing your Facebook message archive (extracted from the zip file Facebook gives you). The file you need exactly is "messages.htm" in the /html folder. 

When you're in the right directory, enter in the command:
```
fbcap ./messages.htm -f csv > msgs_csv.csv
```
which will give you the CSV file with data formatted into these columns: ['thread'], ['sender'], ['date'], and ['message']. Save or rename this CSV file as "msg_csv.csv", and store it into the root folder of Emoter (where emoter_corpus_fb_parser.py is in).

Running 'emoter_corpus_fb_parser.py' allows you to enter in the full name of the Facebook user to automatically parse and generate a usable Emoter corpus, after the initial parsing with fbchat-archive-parser. To create a corpus off a single individual profile, only responses said by the specified user directly after an 'other' user message are counted.

<img src="/screenshots/emoter-fb-corpus-parser.png?raw=true" width="600px" />

The end result will give you a text file with the generated Facebook corpus, output as "final_msgs.txt", which is currently NOT a usable file. I was unable to parse the lines from the text file without getting Unicode decoding errors. To circumvent this and obtain an actually working corpus, you have to open the final SQL database generated, "new_msgs_db.db", into the program DB Browser for SQLite ([http://sqlitebrowser.org](http://sqlitebrowser.org)). Once you have the final table with all the information open in DB Browser, select all the message-pair responses in the database, and copy and paste it into a text file. Every line should contain the message, in quotes, followed by a single tab ("\t"), and the response, also in quotes. 

See the below image for to see all the new files generated you should have in your directory now. 
<img src="/screenshots/facebook_corpus_files.png?raw=true" width="600px" />

Opening "new_msgs_db.db" should give you a data set with two columns: 'other' and 'profile'.
<img src="/screenshots/facebook_corpus_db_final.png?raw=true" width="300px" />

Select the entirety of the database in DB Browser, and copy and paste the contents into the texts_all.txt file in Emoter's corpus (make sure to put it in a separate brain folder, and specify the path name of the brain).

See the below image for an example of the format of the final corpus you should have, in texts_all.txt.
<img src="/screenshots/facebook_corpus_parsed.png?raw=true" width="600px" />

Delete all the db and CSV and other files created in the process to clean up.

Right now, there is no automated classification of the the Facebook corpus to be used in Emoter's empathy. You currently can only do that manually.


## Current Limitations

* System for deriving 10 additional tones from base 26 has not yet been implemented
* Emoter agents only search for one matching database, not multiple. If the threshold fails, then Emoter will just search the entire database.
* Conversations / texts are just lists of tuples, which is too limiting of a data structure to support future features, like conversation threading
* No automated way of training Facebook messages database for Emoter's "empathic" responses


## Future Plans

* Functionality to automatically load interchangable databases / corpuses (Pickled files) to narrow down contexts in Emote
* Add an "improvisation" feature for Emoter agents to build new dialog through Markov chains and / or neural networks
* Develop automated way of training databases 
* Develop a GUI web interface to create / customize Emoter chatbot agents
* Implement short-term memory functionality for Emoter agents by keeping track of occurences of conversational "tags" in a database
* Improve sequence matching by incorporating automatic addition of synonyms for words and phrases
* Build a Unity SDK for Emote / Emoter
* Incorporation with speech recognition and speech synthesis
* Incorporation with computer vision
